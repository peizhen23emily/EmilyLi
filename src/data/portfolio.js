    overview: 'This project redesigned Vanguard\'s Year-in-Review experience for adults aged 50+, a demographic with strong retirement planning needs but often experiencing anxiety around financial volatility. The redesign focuses on three core pillars: clarity, reassurance, and actionability — ensuring users can understand their financial position, feel confident about their future, and know what steps to take next.',
    process: [
      'Created user personas and journey maps for the 50+ demographic',
      'Designed low-fidelity wireframes exploring multiple layout approaches',
      'Developed high-fidelity mockups with a focus on legibility and emotional tone',
      'Conducted user testing with five participants, each in an intensive 1-hour interview session',
      'Iterated on designs based on qualitative feedback and observed pain points'
    ],
    outcomes: [
      'Redesigned experience centered on clarity, reassurance, and actionability',
      'Identified key anxiety triggers in the original design and addressed them directly',
      'Produced a design system tailored to the visual and cognitive needs of 50+ users',
      'Validated concepts through rigorous 1-on-1 user testing sessions'

    overview: 'The Physics 114 Instructor Dashboard was designed to give instructors a centralized, intuitive interface for monitoring student progress, identifying at-risk learners, and making data-informed decisions throughout the course lifecycle.',
    problemStatement: 'Instructors lacked a unified view of student performance data. Information was scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to intervene early or tailor instruction to class needs.',
    process: [
      'Interviewed instructors and teaching assistants to understand workflow pain points',
      'Mapped the current state of data access and identified gaps',
      'Designed low-fidelity wireframes for key dashboard views',
      'Built high-fidelity mockups with an emphasis on data clarity and quick scanning',
      'Conducted usability walkthroughs with instructors for feedback and iteration'
    ],
    outcomes: [
      'Consolidated multi-system data into a single instructor-facing dashboard',
      'Designed views for assignment performance, engagement trends, and at-risk student flags',
      'Improved instructor confidence in identifying students who need early support',
      'Validated design with real Physics 114 instructors at UNC-Chapel Hill'

    title: 'Cook Out Course Checkpoint — Articulate Storyline',
    tags: ['Instructional Design', 'E-Learning', 'Articulate Storyline'],
    description: 'Designed an interactive e-learning course checkpoint for students using Articulate Storyline, reinforcing key concepts through engaging scenario-based knowledge checks.',

    heroImage: 'https://i.imgur.com/Na5mNit.jpeg',
   prototypeUrl: 'https://share.articulate.com/f2jn-tLEFCV77tp8WMqdt',
    overview: 'This project is an e-learning course checkpoint built in Articulate Storyline, designed to assess and reinforce student understanding at a critical point in the learning journey. Using Cook Out as a real-world context, the checkpoint engages students through interactive scenarios and knowledge checks rather than passive reading or traditional quizzes.',
    problemStatement: 'Standard course assessments often feel disconnected from real-world application, leading to surface-level engagement and poor knowledge retention. The goal was to design a checkpoint that feels meaningful, contextual, and motivating for students — one that truly measures understanding rather than memorization.',
    process: [
      'Defined learning objectives and mapped checkpoint content to course outcomes',
      'Designed the course structure, branching logic, and interactive question flow in Articulate Storyline',
      'Created visual layouts and interactive elements to keep students engaged throughout',
      'Built scenario-based questions grounded in real-world context to promote deeper thinking',
      'Reviewed and iterated on content using instructional design best practices'
    ],
    outcomes: [
      'Delivered a fully interactive e-learning course checkpoint in Articulate Storyline',
      'Scenario-based format promotes applied thinking over rote memorization',
      'Self-paced and visually engaging design improves student completion rates',
      'Ready for SCORM-compliant LMS deployment'
