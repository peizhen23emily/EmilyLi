    overview: 'This project redesigned Vanguard\'s Year-in-Review experience for adults aged 50+, a demographic with strong retirement planning needs but often experiencing anxiety around financial volatility. The redesign focuses on three core pillars: clarity, reassurance, and actionability — ensuring users can understand their financial position, feel confident about their future, and know what steps to take next.',
    outcomes: [
      'Redesigned experience centered on clarity, reassurance, and actionability',
      'Identified key anxiety triggers in the original design and addressed them directly',
      'Produced a design system tailored to the visual and cognitive needs of 50+ users',
      'Validated concepts through rigorous 1-on-1 user testing sessions'

    overview: 'The Physics 114 Instructor Dashboard was designed to give instructors a centralized, intuitive interface for monitoring student progress, identifying at-risk learners, and making data-informed decisions throughout the course lifecycle.',
    problemStatement: 'Instructors lacked a unified view of student performance data. Information was scattered across multiple systems, making it difficult to intervene early or tailor instruction to class needs.',
    outcomes: [
      'Consolidated multi-system data into a single instructor-facing dashboard',
      'Designed views for assignment performance, engagement trends, and at-risk student flags',
      'Improved instructor confidence in identifying students who need early support',
      'Validated design with real Physics 114 instructors at UNC-Chapel Hill'

    title: 'Cook Out Course Checkpoint — Articulate Storyline',

    description: 'Designed an interactive e-learning course checkpoint for students using Articulate Storyline, reinforcing key concepts through engaging scenario-based knowledge checks.',
    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/BXHV8mE.jpeg',
   prototypeUrl: 'https://share.articulate.com/f2jn-tLEFCV77tp8WMqdt',
    overview: 'This project is an e-learning course checkpoint built in Articulate Storyline, designed to assess and reinforce student understanding at a critical point in the learning journey. Using Cook Out as a real-world context, the checkpoint engages students through interactive scenarios and knowledge checks rather than passive reading or traditional quizzes.',
    problemStatement: 'Standard course assessments often feel disconnected from real-world application, leading to surface-level engagement and poor knowledge retention. The goal was to design a checkpoint that feels meaningful, contextual, and motivating for students — one that truly measures understanding rather than memorization.',
    outcomes: [
      'Delivered a fully interactive e-learning course checkpoint in Articulate Storyline',
      'Scenario-based format promotes applied thinking over rote memorization',
      'Self-paced and visually engaging design improves student completion rates',
      'Ready for SCORM-compliant LMS deployment'

    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/zkk7wJu.jpeg',
    pdfFile: 'Essay.pdf',
    overview: 'This essay examines the discrimination and isolation faced by cross-border students (CBS) from mainland China studying in Hong Kong secondary schools. It explores how colonial history, language bias (Cantonese/English vs. Mandarin), biased liberal studies textbooks, and the grueling daily border-crossing experience all contribute to mainland students feeling marginalized and unable to fully integrate into Hong Kong school life.',

    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/ylCs4iV.png',
    pdfFile: 'LAK26.pdf',
    overview: 'This study investigates how the timing of exam preparation relates to academic performance among 884 undergraduates in an introductory biology course. The core problem is that most students delay or avoid early planning — only 16.5% accessed study guides at all — raising questions about how self-regulated learning behaviors like planning and engagement connect to exam outcomes.',

    image: 'https://i.imgur.com/zpKaQx4.png',
    pdfFile: 'codetolearn.pdf',
    overview: 'This project proposes an adaptive learning module for middle school students using Scratch, addressing the problem that while students engage enthusiastically with coding tasks, they often lack the self-regulated learning skills — planning, monitoring, and reflecting — needed to make meaningful progress. The solution embeds two feedback layers (a real-time Step Loop during coding and a post-task Task Loop) that detect students\' behavioral patterns and deliver personalized prompts to guide more strategic learning without restricting their creativity.',
